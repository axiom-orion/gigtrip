"""Great-circle (haversine) distance between venues, in kilometres.

This is a straight-line distance, **not** road or flight routing — stated plainly because
the optimizer's travel budget is only as honest as its cost model. It is monotonic in true
travel cost, which is what the selection needs; swap in a real routing/airfare API to make
the kilometre budget a dollar budget without touching the optimizer.
