"""Core datatypes for the gigtrip itinerary optimizer.

An itinerary is an ordered set of live events (concerts / games / comedy) you attend on a
trip out of a home base. Because every event has a *fixed date*, the visit order is forced
by the calendar — so planning is a **selection** problem under travel constraints, not a
travelling-salesman ordering problem. See `optimizer.py`.
